# Startup sound

when knoppix starts its plays sound befote filesystem is mounted 
and even before everything else. I would like to 
recreate that im my system. Iv done some research here:

this one is very good:

[ramfs](https://github.com/MartinOehler/LINBOv3/tree/master/Sources/Knoppix/etc/init.d)

and this one as service. after filesystem mounted 
actualy very late. Too late:

[service](https://github.com/axtloss/linux-boot-sound/blob/master/bootsoundInstaller)
